#Demonstrating an example of Extracting a signature from the request form, preparing it for print ready 

• Used Elixer tool for editing and filtering images
• Manual intervention required at multiple steps
• Turnaround time: 2 weeks
• High dependency on licenses and human resources
New Approach with Agentic Workflow
• Direct processing from Kanban Board story
• Automated flow without manual file editing
• Integration with YOLO model for signature identification
• Converts extracted signature into scalable format for OpenText program

How YOLO Model Helps
• Detects and extracts signature from request form automatically
• Reduces resizing and formatting errors
• Provides output ready for OpenText integration
• Eliminates redundant processing steps

Benefits of the New System
• Speed: Cuts processing time from 2 weeks to a few hours/days
• Efficiency: Reduced human intervention
• Cost Savings: Lower license costs and reduced manual workload
• Scalability: Can handle higher request volumes effortlessly

Business Impact
• Faster customer request delivery
• Enhanced customer satisfaction
• Optimized resource allocation
• Increased ROI by reducing time and license investments

Future Scope
• Extend YOLO model to detect other document artifacts
• Greater automation for OpenText program workflows
• Continuous improvement through feedback loops
